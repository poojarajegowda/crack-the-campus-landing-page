# Technical Approach

The project follows a component-driven architecture where every UI section is developed as an independent and reusable component. The primary goal was to build a scalable landing page that is easy to maintain and extend.

### Component-Based Development

The application is divided into reusable UI components such as:

- Button
- Container
- Section Heading
- Feature Card
- Course Card
- Testimonial Card

These reusable components reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

### Data-Driven Rendering

Instead of hardcoding content directly inside components, data such as features, courses, testimonials, statistics, and company information is stored in separate JavaScript files inside the `data` folder.

This approach makes updating the content easier without modifying component logic.

### Responsive Design

The UI is fully responsive using Tailwind CSS utility classes.

Breakpoints are used to provide an optimized experience across:

- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

### Theme Management

Dark and Light mode are implemented using React Context API.

The selected theme is:

- stored in Local Storage
- restored on page refresh
- initialized using the user's system preference

### Animations

Framer Motion is used for section entrance animations.

Additional animations include:

- Animated company logo marquee
- Infinite scrolling courses
- Animated testimonial columns
- Count-up statistics animation
- Smooth hover interactions
